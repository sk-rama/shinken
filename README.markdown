# Shinken plugins

This repository contains a collection a shinken/nagios plugins we found on the web and we are using to monitor our servers. We put them in a repository because we deploy our servers using ansible, and it is much faster to clone a repo than to copy dozens of files one by one on dozens of hosts.

Each script brings its own licence.
